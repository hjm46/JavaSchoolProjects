# JavaSchoolProjects

This is code I worte for projects during my CS classes in college. 

__MOST OF THESE FILES WILL NOT RUN BECAUSE THEY RELY ON MY PROFESSORS FILES__

All of the code here I have extensively worked on or written completely on my own.
Most notable projects are the DLB which includes the Auto Completer and User History, and Clustering which includes the BucketMapGenerator, ClusteringMapGenerator, CircularHueMetric, ColorQuantizer, and SquaredEuclideanMetric.
